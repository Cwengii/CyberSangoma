🌍 First — What’s a “Cyber Sangoma”?

You know how a Sangoma in our culture is someone who helps people heal, protect themselves from bad energy, and see what’s really going on spiritually?
Now imagine if that Sangoma lived in the digital world — like inside your phone or laptop.
Instead of fighting bad spirits…
They fight bad data, scams, viruses, and hackers!
So the Cyber Sangoma is a funny, wise character who teaches people how to “protect their digital spirit” — meaning, how to stay safe online.

🎬 The Main Idea
Your team creates a short, fun animated mini-series (2 minutes per episode).
Each episode shows a story of a person who’s been “cursed” by a digital problem —
for example:
    • Someone’s phone got hacked because they clicked a fake link.
    • A person’s WhatsApp got stolen because they shared their OTP.
    • A granny got tricked by a fake bank SMS.
Then the Cyber Sangoma arrives! 🪘
He or she uses “digital herbs” and “firewalls” to cleanse the phone and teach the lesson.
It’s funny, it’s local, it uses our languages, and it sneaks in real Cybersecurity lessons without sounding boring or technical.

🎨 Example Episode Ideas
Episode 1: “The Curse of the Fake Bank SMS”
A man gets an SMS saying “FNB account locked.” He panics and clicks. Boom! Money gone.
Cyber Sangoma appears with digital incense, saying:
“My child, not all messages from the ancestors are real… some are from scammers!”
Then teaches him to check URLs, never click random links, and report scams.
Episode 2: “The Spirit of the Public Wi-Fi”
A student connects to free Wi-Fi at a café. Her data gets stolen.

Cyber Sangoma tells her:
“Free Wi-Fi is like free food on the street — you don’t know who cooked it.”
Then shows her how to use VPNs and safe connections.
Episode 3: “The Catfish Curse”
A woman falls for a fake online boyfriend.
Cyber Sangoma reveals the truth and explains signs of catfishing and privacy protection.

🎵 The Vibe
    • Tone: Humorous, friendly, and deeply South African.
    • Style: Mix of local languages, proverbs, and modern slang.
    • Visuals: Bright African colors, beads, digital smoke, traditional meets tech.
    • Music: African drums with techy sounds — think sangoma meets sci-fi.


📊 The Data Angle (Important for Discothon)
You’ll collect or show simple data like:
    • “Top 5 most common scams in South Africa” (from SABRIC/CSIR).
    • “How many people report phishing or fake SMSes.”
    • Maybe even run a small survey: ‘Have you ever clicked a suspicious link?’
Then, you show how your campaign could help reduce those numbers by making people aware through entertainment.

🏁 Summary (Simple Recap)
Cyber Sangoma is about:
    • Teaching cyber safety through African storytelling.
    • Mixing tradition with technology.
    • Using data + humor + art to make people care about cybersecurity.
